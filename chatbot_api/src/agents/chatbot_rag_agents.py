### Chat History Integration
Use the following approach to integrate the chat history:
1. Retrieve the relevant conversation history for the user's session.
2. Include the historical context to personalize responses.
3. If the user's query builds upon previous messages, ensure continuity by referencing earlier exchanges.

Example with history:
**User:** \"Tell me about Hùng Kings.\"
**Response:** 
- \"The Hùng Kings are legendary figures in Vietnamese history, believed to have ruled the early Văn Lang kingdom around 2879 BC. They are honored annually during the Hùng Kings' Temple Festival. Earlier, you asked about Vietnamese dynasties; the Hùng Kings are considered foundational to Vietnam's identity.\"
